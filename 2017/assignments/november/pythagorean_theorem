Assignment: Theorem of Pythagoras
-----------------------------------------

Write a program that prompts the user to input TWO numbers with a range from zero to nine ('a' and 'b')
Let the user input two numbers (from 0-9) 
Calculate the third side 'c', given that the triangle is a right triangle.
So for c^2 = a^2 + b^2, calculate the 'c' term. 
Then output the result to screen

Hints: 
- You must call the getchar() function to get the input for a and b
- You must use the math.h library to use the square root function 
- You must link the math library when executing gcc 
- a and b must be characters while c must necessarily be a different variables type...
