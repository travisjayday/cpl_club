ASSIGNMENT -- LISTING ALL INTEGERS FROM 0 TO 63535
----------------------------------------------------

Implementation #1:

1) Create a skeleton of a standard C program
2) Declare variable c and initialize it to zero
3) While c is less than or equal to 65536
	- Print the value of c
	- Increment c

Challenge #1: 
1) Can you list all the powers of two from 2 to 65536?
- For example, create a program that outputs: 
	2
	4
	8
	16
	32
	...
	65536
