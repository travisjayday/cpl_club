Write a program that asks the user for a password. 
Then compare the inputted password with a predefined password string. 
To compare the arrays, use a for loop (to compare character by character)

1. declare and initialize the true password
2. declare an input password
3. ask the user for user input for the input password
4. compare the passwords with a for loop, character by character. 
	- make a for loop that loops from 0 to STRING_LENGTH and compares each
		element of true password with input password. 
	- IF characters DO NOT match, print "Access denied scrubby"
	- IF characters DO match, print "Hey boii. Welcome to the matrix"
