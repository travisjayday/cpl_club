-Write a program that rolls a 6 sided die and outputs the rolled number to the screen. If the number is 4,5,6 then print “you’ve won the game” if the number is 1,2,3 print “you are a loser.” So for example:

—————————-
(Case 1)
./a.out
You rolled a 5.
You’ve won the game.

(Case 2)
./a.out
You rolled a 3.
You are a loser.
——————————

Remember: a die has 6 sides and you can roll the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Brainstorm on how to write the program before implementing it (remember planning,implementation,compilation,testing)

Tip: you will have to use the random function and the modulus operator and if statements.

Good luck.
