Implementing the Quadratic Formula
-----------------------------------------------------------------
First, familiarize yourself with the formula. Then..

Our first algorithm should be implemented like so: 
- Declare real number variables a, b, c, disc, x1, and x2

- Initialize the input variables a,b,c to some number (test: 8 2 2)

- Assign the variable disc to the discriminint of a, b, c.
	(the discriminint is B^2 - 4AC) 

- Assign x1 to the first solution of the quadratic equation
	(i.e. negative b PLUS squareroot of discriminiant over 2a) 

- Assign x2 to the second solution of the quadratic equation
	(i.e. negative b MINUS squareroot of discriminant over 2a)

- Print to screen "Solution1: [value of x1], Solution2: [value of x2]"
