The goal of this assignment is to create a webpage that visually looks like the
Google search engine from 1998. Reference image here: http://blogoscoped.com/files/google-com-history/thumb/1997.jpg

Step 1: Desiging the webpage 
--------------------------------

Directions: 
	- Create an html file
	- Write a webpage that looks like old_google.jpeg 

Resources: 
	- For the google logo, the image is found at: 
		https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/1998-copy.jpg 
	- The "About Google" link refers to: 
	 	https://www.google.com/about/	
	- Note: clicking the buttons does not do anything yet

Hints: 
	- You probably have to use the following html tags: 
		- <script>
		- <div>
		- <img>
		- <button>
		- <input type='text'...
		- <a href.../>
		- <p>
		- <i>, <u>
		
Step 2: Making the buttons do stuff
--------------------------------

Directions: 
	- Create a script that when the button is clicked, the browser will navigate 
	   to http://google.com/search?q=XXXXX where XXXXX is whatever the user 
	   inputted in your html textfield
	- Use the button onClick attribute to link your script with your button
	- Use window.location.href = '...' in javascript to go to a url
