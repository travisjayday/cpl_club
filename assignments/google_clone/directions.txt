The goal of this assignment is to create a webpage that visually looks like the Google search engine from 1998. 

Directions: 
	- Create an html file

		https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/1998-copy.jpg 
	- The "About Google" link refers to: 
	 	https://www.google.com/about/	
	- Note: clicking the buttons does not do anything yet

Hints: 
	- You must use the following html tags: 
		- <div>
		- <img>

		- <input type='text'...
		- <a href.../>

If you've finished:

	- Use the button onClick attribute to link your script with your button
	- Use window.location.href = '...' in javascript to go to a url
