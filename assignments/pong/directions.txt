Objective: 
	- Make a Pong Game

Directions: 
	- Use HTML Canvas and JavaScript to make a Pong Game (60 Marks) 

Hints: 
		------------------------------- Step 1 (Controls) ----------------------------------
		- Initialize the Canvas
		- Use setInterval() to call a drawing function over and over
		- In the drawing function, draw two rectangles, one for each player peddle
		- Create a variable to control the position of the player peddle (don't worry about the enemy peddle yet)
		- Create functions that changes the variable (e.g. goUp(), goDown())
		- Create two buttons that make the peddle go up or down

		------------------------------- Step 2 (Physics) ----------------------------------
		- Create a ball at the middle of the screen with two variables for its position
		- Create variables for its x and y velocity. At the end of each drawcall, update the ball positions by adding the velocities to them. 
		- Give it an initial x velocity (later you may generate random intial velocities)  
			e.g. ballPosX = ballPosX + ballVelX
		- Use if statements to determine when the ball hits the side of the canvas and flip the x velocity:
			if (ballX < 0) {
				ballVelX = -ballVelX 
			}
		- If the ball hits the top or bottom, flip the y-velocity
		- At this point, you must implement peddle collision detection. 
		- You must check if, when the ball is hitting the left side, the y-value of the ball is greater than the y-value of the peddle
			and less than the y-value of the peddle + the height of the peddle. If that is true, the ball collided, so flip the x-velocity. 
			If not, restart the game by setting the position of the ball to the center of the screen (you may add a score system later)
		
		------------------------------- Step 3 (Enemy AI) ----------------------------------
		- To make the AI, make a variable for the y-position of the enemy peddle. 
		- If the ball y position is greater than the enemy peddle position, add to the enemey peddle position
		- Else, if the ball y position is less than the enemy position (if ball is above peddle), subtract from the enemy peddle position
		- Now you've created super intelligent artificial intelligence system!!

		------------------------------- Step 4 (Extra Things) ----------------------------------
		- Things to possibly entertain: 
			- Can we display the score on the canvas? 
			- Can we generate intitial random velocities for the ball? 
			- Can we use jQuery to get input from the keyboard instead of buttons? 
			- Can we play collision sounds when the ball hits something? 
			- Can we make the AI more intelligent? 

Remarks: 	
	- Once we've finished the game, we'll host it on the web so that we can play it anywhere. 
	- If you have questions or are lost please text Travis (956) 867-8756 or send an email to travis.ziegler.rho@iblamar.org 
	- Possibly create some original simple games using this method. 
	- Have fun!
