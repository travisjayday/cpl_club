Lecture: 
- Explain the difference of chars and integers in terms of ram 
	- Ram is divided into cells
	- Integers take 4 bytes of space 	–2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
	- Chars take 1 byte of space		-128 to 127
	- long long 8 bytes			–9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807


- First show the example of addresses. 
- Show the address print and variable size program  
- Then show the Scanf integer input variable progarm 

-Assignment 1: 
- Expand the pythagorean theorem program so that it asks the user to input two numbers for sides a and b (with a range from 0 to 9). 
- Tips: 
	- Use a char variable for getting input with the getchar() function
	- Then just call your pythagoream_thm() function that you made last time with the inputted values
	- You must test to see if you're getting the correct output

- Then show the example of the for loop.
 Write a program that
